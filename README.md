## Task description

WY Space has a fleet of satellites, and a ground station to communicate with them. Each satellite has a downlink rate
measured in units per 30 minutes. The ground station has a maximum bandwidth that it can handle at any one time; it can
handle multiple satellites in parallel.

A satellite can only downlink data when the ground station can see it, this window is called a pass.

When the pass begins, the connection and downlink to the ground station is immediate, you may assume there are no
delays. Similarly, the downlink will immediately stop when the pass ends. All passes are a minimum of 30 minutes.

**QUESTIONS:**

- WY Space would like to take a text based schedule (detailed below) and use a program that can find the 30 minutes
  period where the total downlink (all satellite passes) will be at its maximum.
- Furthermore, they would like the program to determine if the ground station has the bandwidth to support this.

Since WY Space want to use your solution for multiple ground stations, the bandwidth of the ground station should be
provided as an argument to the program.

**Attached File: pass-schedule.txt**

This is a text based schedule WY Space expect to use with your program.

**The format is as follows:**

Each line represents a single pass. A pass contains the satellite name, itâ€™s bandwidth per 30 minutes period, the start
time of the pass, and the end time of the pass. The four elements of a pass are comma separated.

### Notes to the candidate

Include a README text file detailing how we run your solution. The README can be in a format of your choice, e.g.
plaintext, markdown, Word document etc.

## ASSUMPTIONS / DEFINITIONS

- pass of a satellite start and end at exactly at the beginning of a minute, e.i. seconds, milliseconds etc. are always
  0
- **start times are inclusive, end times are exclusive**
  - e.g. satellite A is broadcasting at 8:30, 8:31, 8:32 ... 9:28, 9:29 but not at 9:30
- **total downlink** at any moment is the sum of the strength of all currently passing satellites
  - e.g. total downlink at 8:29 is 2 while 8:30 is 7
- **value of 30 minutes of total downlink** is the sum of total downlink in all minutes in that 30 minutes window
  - e.g. value of 30 minutes of total downlink from 7:45 to 8:15 is: 135, which can be calculated the following way:
    - total downlink from 7:45 to 8:00 is 2 in every minute, 15 \* 2 = 30 overall
    - total downlink from 8:00 to 8:15 is 7 in every minute, 15 \* 7 = 105 overall
    - therefore value of 30 minutes of total downlink is 135 (105 + 30)
- **period of maximum total downlink**
  - is the 30 minutes where the total downlink will be at maximum, e.i. no other 30 minutes window have greater "overall
    strength"
- **bandwidth of a ground station** supports 30 minutes of total downlink if in every minute of that 30 minutes the
  total downlink is less or equal than the bandwidth.

| NAME | STRENGTH | START TIME | END TIME |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| A    | 2        | 07:30      | 08:30    |
| B    | 5        | 08:00      | 09:00    |

## USAGE

- Last release available at: https://us-central1-wy-space.cloudfunctions.net/wy-space
- Last version on main available at: https://us-central1-wy-space.cloudfunctions.net/wy-space-next
- Example usage:

```shell
curl -F "file=@./src/integration/resources/pass-schedule.txt" \
https://us-central1-wy-space.cloudfunctions.net/wy-space\?bandwidth\=13
```

- Rules of input:
  - Header _Content-Type_ must include _multipart/form-data_ (curl set it up automatically)
  - file is mandatory parameter
  - bandwidth is optional parameter, has to be a positive number
  - lines of the file should be: name,strength/bandwidth,start-time,end-time where:
    - **name** is a string containing the name of the satellite
    - **strength/bandwidth** per 30 minutes period it has to be a positive natural number
    - **start-time** is the start time of the pass, it follows HH:mm pattern
    - **end-time** is the end time of the pass, it follows HH:mm pattern
    - all fields should be separated by comma without any space

## DEPLOYMENT

### Deployment

The application has two automatic continuous deployment GitHub actions for deploying to Google Cloud Platform.

- [wy-space](https://us-central1-wy-space.cloudfunctions.net/wy-space):
  - Every new GitHub release triggers a release to wy-space, see: [cd-release](.github/workflows/cd-release.yml)
    1. `npx commit-and-tag-version --packageFiles build.gradle --bumpFiles build.gradle.kts`
    1. `git push --follow-tags origin main`
    1. create new release on GitHub from the new tag
- [wy-space-next](https://us-central1-wy-space.cloudfunctions.net/wy-space-next):
  - Every new commit on main branch triggers a release to wy-space-next, see: [cd-next](.github/workflows/cd-next.yml)
- It is also possible to have a manual release (wy-space-test can be changed to any desired name):
  - Prerequisites:
    - java 17
    - google cloud account
    - gcloud
  - steps:
    1. `gcloud auth login`
    1. `./gradlew clean quarkusBuild`
    1. ```shell
         gcloud functions deploy wy-space-test --entry-point=io.quarkus.gcp.functions.QuarkusHttpFunction \
         --trigger-http --runtime=java17 --source=build
       ```
